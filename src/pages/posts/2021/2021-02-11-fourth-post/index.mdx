This has been such a rough year. I decided to take a paid course to hopefully help me get a firm grasp on the fundamentals of the js language.
I'm taking Wes Boss' Beginner JS Course and am at the second half of the exercises. I was planning on postingg everything I learned from the course here, but since I use the course as a reference and jump around to different videos I will instead create projects to practice what I learned and highlight the particular part of my code where the course has given me more context and understanding. A rough list of some of the things I learned and didn't know enough about or struggled with using small projects: 

1) Working with the DOM portion: Hoisting, closures, propagation and event bubbling<br/>
2) Accessibility using Aria tags I need to delve into this more on creating elements and apps that have Accessibility (Created scroll to accept and tabs example here)<br/>
3) Intervals and Timers - Particularly with this I struggled with executing intervals at the right time and clearing them when I didn't need them anymore. (short project I made for this here)<br/>
4) Objects - I didn't know about the method object.freeze() to make an object immutable. I never really had the need for this but I made a sample project here trying it out. <br/>
5) Obj ref vs values Deep clone using lodash - I dont have a lot of experience with lodash but I know that this could come up again in the future
6) Maps similar to a dictionary or an object in js but maintains its order of elements and has its own methods - exercise I did here

This was just the first half, for the second half I'll make a new post with what I've been workin on
