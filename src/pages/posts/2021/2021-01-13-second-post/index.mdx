### Second Post 

For now I have the timer working on the pomodoro app. I am using setInterval() and setting the state to decrease the minutes which will wait for 6000ms and seconds by 1000ms. <br/>I don't know if that is the best approach for this but I can refactor later. I'm also trying to figure out the best way to structure my files and components. <br/>This simple little app is basically a timer and todo app. I hope that I can improve the UI and learn better styling practices in the process, the colors I chose was for accessibility I might change them again later.

One new thing I learned today was how to use setInterval() and how to use clearInterval() in componentWillUnmount(). I'm getting a better hang of lifecycle methods but need to get better at it.
