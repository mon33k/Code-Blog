I worked on my Pomodoro app and I worked on this [leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)<br/> The thing I learned new today was how to use componentDidUpdate() to get the previous props and previous state in a component to get the time from my Timer.js component to App.js so that I can pass the time to other components in my app. 

```
    When highlight.js or prism.js works ill add my code here lol 
```
