### Slow day today, but I push onwards!

I worked on adding prismjs to this blog to be able to add code snippets and also added gatsby-remark-images to add images and gifs.<br/> Slow day today but will work more on the Pomodoro app tomorrow, I want to finish the controls where you can play, pause and stop the timer.<br/>
If I can get that working I will just have the todo part and that should be easy enough to try to work on another project, maybe another frontend mentor one?


Helpful guides I found for gatsby syntax highlighting:

I worked on my Pomodoro app and I worked on this [leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)<br/> The thing I learned new today was how to use componentDidUpdate() to get the previous props and previous state in a component to get the time from my Timer.js component to App.js so that I can pass the time to other components in my app.
