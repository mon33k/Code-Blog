### Slow day today, but I push onwards!

I worked on adding prismjs to this blog to be able to add code snippets and also added gatsby-remark-images to add images and gifs.<br/> Slow day today but will work more on the Pomodoro app tomorrow, I want to finish the controls where you can play, pause and stop the timer.<br/>
If I can get that working I will just have the todo part and that should be easy enough to try to work on another project, maybe another frontend mentor one?
